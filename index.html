                    spices, and fruits, so each manufacturer puts its own spin on the recipe. The best-known brand is Fernet Branca,

                    The original recipe was called Gricia (which is still prepared in central Italy), was not tomato-based as tomatoes had not been 
                    introduced into Italy at that stage.  As we know it today, the recipe became very popular in Rome during the 19th century as economic
                     contacts between Rome and Amatrice became stronger.</p>

                <p class="w3-text-white">There are many hypotheses for the origins of this well-loved dish.
                     The ingredients’ simplicity could mean that it was an easy dish for the charcoal makers “Carbonari”
                      who spent long periods of time in the woods during the year. However, the fact that we do not see reference 
                      to this dish in Italian cookbooks until after the Second World War could demonstrate that Roman trattorias invented it 
                      to keep the American troops happy using ingredients (eggs and bacon) standard issue for the US soldiers.</p>

                <p class="w3-text-white">Spaghetti Bolognaise is probably the most popular pasta dish outside Italy. 
                    However, in Bologna, Ragù Alla Bolognese is always served with egg tagliatelle, which is better for holding the 
                    heavy meat sauce. Dating back to at least the 1400s, Bolognaise was originally tomato-less and even today should taste more 
                    of meat than tomato sauce. There have been so many variations on this beloved dish that in 1982 the Bolognese delegation of Accademia 
                    Italiana della Cucina deemed it necessary to issue the “correct” classic Ragù recipe.</p>

                <p class="w3-text-white">Considered to traditionally come from the Abruzzo region, this cheap and cheerful dish is now popular 
                    in the length and breadth of the boot. As there are very few ingredients (garlic, olive oil, chili, parsley, and spaghetti),
                     it is usually the first dish young Italians learn to make. It is also the dish that will most often be offered to you,
                      “facciamo due spaghetti,” if you end up back at an Italian friend’s house after a night on the beer!</p>
